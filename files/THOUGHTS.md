based on reflection of Marcus Aurelius's comments from Meditations

"What? may not this that now I go about, be of the number of unnecessary actions? Neither must he use himself to cut off actions only, but thoughts and imaginations also that are unnecessary for so will unnecessary consequent actions the better be prenvented and cut off."

## necessary
food
study
sleep
exercise
meditation
social
nature, from experience many thinkers
and to a degree?
 * entertainment
 * news
 * blogs

betterment: is this even a word? what would this even entail? Some actions under this category would fall under vanity, or other desireless categories
  ### the good
    * speach
    * thought
    * Being     Ha! read Heidegger
    * good works within a community
      * community is that part of an individual that doesn't parish, but continues
    * art

I want to attempt a week of just betterment. First step? more research
