[quadrature] is a historical term which means the process of determining area
Solving an equation by [quadrature] mean expressing its solution in terms of
integrals. In ancient Greece mathematicians understood determination of the area
of a figure as the progress of constructing a square that had the same area.

A [transcendental number] is a real number or complex number that is not an
algebraic number, that is not a root (i.e. solution) of a nonzero polynomial
equation with integer coefficients. pi and e are examples.
